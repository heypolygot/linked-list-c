# Linked Lists Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Linked List** implementations in C. The repository is designed to help learners and developers understand and practice working with linked data structures, one of the fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a resourceful and hands-on guide for:
- Learning the basics of linked lists and how they work.
- Implementing various types of linked lists (e.g., singly, doubly, and circular).
- Practicing common operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal on linked lists.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding memory management concepts in C.

This project is suitable for:
- Beginners studying data structures.
- Students working on academic assignments.
- Developers revisiting or strengthening their knowledge of linked lists.

## Key Features

- Implementation of different types of linked lists:
  - **Singly Linked List**
  - **Doubly Linked List**
  - **Circular Linked List**
- Code examples and functions for common operations:
  - **Creation**: Dynamically allocate memory to initialize new linked list nodes.
  - **Insertion**: Add new elements to the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list.
  - **Deletion**: Remove elements from the beginning, end, or a specific position in the list.
  - **Traversing**: Iterate through the list to access or display each element.
  - **Updating**: Modify the data within specific nodes of the list.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, you will need:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Compilation

Compile the programs using:
```bash
gcc linkedlist_example.c -o linkedlist_example
